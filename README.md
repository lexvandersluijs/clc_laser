On November 5th and 6th of 2021 the City Life Church Leaders Conference was organized in The Hague.

To add extra and unique visuals to the event I created some custom laser effects, which were projected using two 2 Watt lasers mounted in the trusses above the stage.

A combination of effects was used: about half of them were based on SVG vector graphics created in Adobe Illustrator. The other ones are mathematical shapes (lines and superellipses) that are animated based on time and an Onset Detection algorithm.

Below are some pictures and videos that give a good impression of what was visible on the stage.

In the video the laser light appears to flicker: this is due to the limited recording frame-rate of the video camera, in reality the animation is smooth.

All of these laser show elements were created using OpenFrameworks and the brilliant ofxLaser add-in created by Seb Lee. 

This repository has the source code for alle the visuals you see here.
