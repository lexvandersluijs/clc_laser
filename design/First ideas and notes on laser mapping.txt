Laser mapping in CLC

Requirements

											OF / ofxLaser					TouchDesigner
- show 3D spinning logo						?								? No optimization of drawing path?
- show animated lightning flash 			Animated SVG					?
- show mapping on building synced to music	Bangs on timeline tracks*					No timeline? Use multichannel click track?
- show starfield							Own Particle system				Have particles show as lines, send to Laser node?
- show rain falling over the stage**

OF 3D spinning logo:
- read 3D model file (e.g. 3DS - has edge visibility I think)
- tesselate for painter's algo
- draw filled tris and edges back to front
- re-connect edges into polylines

OR

- use EBT visible edge determination code

OR

- render 3D model to texture, with special textures so that only the right edges will be found in the next step
   * or, instead of using special texture with gradient, render the edges to a texture map (see Blender video on 'wear')
     then render tihs object unlit, ( non-maximal suppression + erosion = stages of Canny ED.)
- perform Canny edge detection




Mapping:									Add drawing control
												Create polylines per drawing
												Ability to select point, move it w mouse, nudge w arrow keys
											Save drawing element
											Assign drawing + effect to 'bang'
													Need to implement assignment function. 
													Maybe simply show gallery of shapes with track, then effect selection for each 'bang'
											
											
Effects:
(1) take polyline from start to finish, then create a new one that is an animated segment of it
(2) take polyline, replace with dots
(3) take polyline, flash in and fade out

** could be done with lines going straight down + effect (1)


Special consideration: is it possible to manually trace the decor from where the projector is? Too far away..
Ideas:
  - use Remote desktop and 2nd laptop to go to stage, and do tracing there
  - create 3D reconstruction of stage using photogrammetry, then create 3D polylines, project these to 2D using calibrated pose of projector
     then do show the same way as if 2D elements were drawn directly
	 
  - create 3D models of individual decor pieces, put AR markers on them temporarily, get the exact pose of these using calibrated stereo pair
    then project onto the pieces..
